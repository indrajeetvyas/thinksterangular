go to some folder and run this command:
npm install @angular/cli -g

-g is to install globally ( i think it means angular shall be accessible globally on my machine)

the next thing which you do is create a new project! ( a workspace i presume)

command is ng new <your_project_name>

------ one command which you can use is test out what ng will do but not create anything on file system.
------ it is ng new <project_name> --dryRun
------ this will give a message in the end: NOTE: The "dryRun" flag means no changes were made.

------ another command which you can use is to skip installation of node modules
------ it is ng new <project_name> --skipInstall

so we create project with ng new <your_project_name> (this will take some time so be patient... correcntion.. this may take a lot of time!!!)

oh and it will ask to add routing, just sy yes by pressing 'y' key and add plain CSS for now.

once it does it all you can run it with npm start

and voila!!! access localhost:4200 to see the beautiful app running!!
